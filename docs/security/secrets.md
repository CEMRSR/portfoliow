# Secrets Management

This document provides guidelines and best practices for managing secrets within the kegabmaranan-platform-io project.

## Overview

Secrets are sensitive pieces of information such as passwords, API keys, and tokens that need to be protected to ensure the security of the system. Proper management of secrets is crucial to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches.

## Best Practices

1. **Use Environment Variables**: Store secrets in environment variables instead of hardcoding them in the source code.
2. **Secret Management Tools**: Utilize secret management tools like AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, or Azure Key Vault to securely store and manage secrets.
3. **Access Control**: Restrict access to secrets to only those who need it. Use role-based access control (RBAC) to manage permissions.
4. **Encryption**: Encrypt secrets both at rest and in transit to protect them from unauthorized access.
5. **Regular Rotation**: Regularly rotate secrets to minimize the impact of potential leaks.
6. **Audit and Monitoring**: Implement auditing and monitoring to detect and respond to unauthorized access attempts.
