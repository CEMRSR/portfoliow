## Best Practices

1. **Authentication**: Implement strong authentication mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access the system.
2. **Authorization**: Use role-based access control (RBAC) to manage permissions and ensure that users have the appropriate level of access.
3. **Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data both at rest and in transit to protect it from unauthorized access.
4. **Monitoring and Logging**: Implement monitoring and logging to detect and respond to security incidents.
5. **Regular Audits**: Conduct regular security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
