# Deployment Overview

## Deployment Strategy

Our deployment strategy follows a multi-environment approach with automated CI/CD pipelines and comprehensive monitoring.

### Key Components

    subgraph "Deployment Pipeline"
        GH[GitHub Repository]
        CB[CodeBuild]
        CP[CodePipeline]
        ENVS[Environments]
    end

    subgraph "Infrastructure"
        CDK[AWS CDK]
        CF[CloudFront]
        S3[S3]
        LAMBDA[Lambda]
    end

    GH --> CB
    CB --> CP
    CP --> ENVS
    CDK --> CF
    CDK --> S3
    CDK --> LAMBDA
```

### Environment Strategy

- Development (dev)
- Staging (stage)
- Production (prod)
- Feature environments

### Deployment Process

1. Code commit triggers pipeline
2. Automated testing
3. Infrastructure validation
4. Staged deployments
5. Production release

### Key Features

- Zero-downtime deployments
- Automated rollbacks
- Infrastructure as Code
- Security checks
- Performance monitoring
